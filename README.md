## Overview of NASA's Land Information System

NASA's Land Information System (LIS) is a software framework for high performance terrestrial hydrology modeling and data assimilation developed with the goal of integrating satellite and ground-based observational data products and advanced modeling techniques to produce optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes. LIS is used to study land surface processes and land-atmosphere interactions, using "best available observations" to force and constrain the models. The LIS framework also enables a number of applications including:

* weather and climate model initialization
* water resources management
* natural hazards management

The LIS framework is comprised of three components:

* **Land Information System (LIS)** - the modeling and data assimilation framework
* **Land Data Toolkit (LDT)** - supports the data preprocessing needs for LIS (e.g., parameter data processing, data assimilation support, forcing bias correction)
* **Land Verification Toolkit (LVT)** - environment for model benchmarking and evaluation
