= Connecting to GitHub using SSH
:imagesdir: images

[quote, https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/]
Beginning August 13, 2021, we will no longer accept account passwords when authenticating Git operations on GitHub.com.

GitHub is ditching password authentication in favor of more secure alternatives: SSH keys and Personal Access Tokens. *All users* must transition to one of these options to continue to connect to GitHub using `git` (i.e., to clone, push, and pull). We recommend using link:https://www.ssh.com/ssh/protocol/#how-does-the-ssh-protocol-work[SSH keys] and describe how to set up and use them with `git` below.

IMPORTANT: This process must be completed on each computer you use to interact with GitHub via the command-line (personal computer, Discover, etc.).

== Create a GitHub-specific SSH Key

. In the terminal, change directories into _~/.ssh_:
+
```sh
$ cd ~/.ssh
```

. Think of a unique link:https://www.ssh.com/ssh/passphrase[passphrase] to pair with this SSH key. This passphrase should be 15-20 characters in length and contain a mix of:
+
* Lowercase letters
* Uppercase letters
* Numbers
* Special characters (e.g., !, @, #, $, etc.)
+
For example: `GoddardSpaceFl!ghtCenter1sGr8`

NOTE: In a later step we will add the SSH key to a "keychain" of sorts so you don't have to use this passphrase each time you push or pull with `git`.

[start=3]
. Generate your unique SSH key:
+
```sh
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f id_ed25519-github
```
+
Where,
+
* `-t ed25519` selects the ed25519 encryption algorithm.
* `-f id_ed25519-github` saves the public and private keys in files named _id_ed25519-github_. *Be sure to use the filename option or you risk overwriting an existing key!*
+
Enter the passphrase you created above at the two prompts that appear.
+
If the key was successfully created `ls` should show two new files: __id_ed25519-github__ and __id_ed25519-github.pub__. The file ending with _.pub_ contains your public key and the other file contains your private key.

. Print the contents of the _public_ key file:
+
```sh
$ cat id_ed25519-github.pub
> ssh-ed25519 VQfDM9CRk2SjR+H4BJgcUT31qlmW1GoVnHZmcJMszos= userid@discover##
```
+
Copy the entire line beginning `ssh-ed25519`. This is your public key. It will be unique from the example shown above.

. Open a browser window and go to link:https://github.com[GitHub]. Log in, if necessary, and navigate to your account Settings by clicking on your user icon in the top right:

+
From the Settings menu, click on "SSH and GPG Keys":
+
image:github-ssh-menu-item.PNG[]
+
Click the green "New SSH Key" button in the top right.
+
In the box labeled "Title", add a descriptive label that indicates what machine uses this key to connect to GitHub (e.g., "discover-ed25519" or "work-laptop").
+
Paste the public key in the box labeled "Key" and click "Add SSH Key".

. To avoid having to enter your passphrase any time you connect to GitHub, add your private SSH key to the SSH agent.
+
Return to the terminal and start the SSH agent in the background:
+
```sh
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
```
+
Add your _private_ key to the SSH agent:
+
```sh
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519-github
```
+
Enter your passphrase at the prompt.

. Tell `ssh` which key to use when connecting to GitHub.
+
Open _~/.ssh/config_ with a text editor and add the following:
+
```text
Host github
  Hostname github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519-github
```
+
[NOTE]
====
If _~/.ssh/config_ is not empty, add a blank line between the previous section and the new text.

If you used a different filename for your SSH key, modify the path after `IdentityFile` to point to your key file.
====

Your new SSH key is ready for use with GitHub. Remember to repeat the steps above on any other machines you use to connect to GitHub.

== Using SSH with Git & GitHub

Switching to SSH keys requires a small change in the way you use `git` to interact with GitHub.

Previously, HTTPS URLs were used when cloning or adding remote repositories:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/NASA-LIS/LISF
```

Now you will have to use SSH URLs. For GitHub, the full SSH URL takes the form `git@github.com:username/repository`. However, the additions made to your _~/.ssh/config_ file allow you to simplify this to `github:username/repository`. For example:

```sh
$ git clone github:NASA-LIS/LISF
```

The same goes for adding remote repositories:

```sh
$ git remote add upstream github:NASA-LIS/LISF
```

=== Updating Existing Repositories to use SSH URLs

Any existing local repositories must be updated to use SSH URLs before August 13, 2021.

. Change directories into an existing repository.

. View the list of remote repositories being tracked:
+
```sh
$ git remote -v
> origin	https://github.com/bmcandr/LISF (fetch)
> origin	https://github.com/bmcandr/LISF (push)
> upstream	https://github.com/NASA-LIS/LISF (fetch)
> upstream	https://github.com/NASA-LIS/LISF (push)
```

[start=3]
. Set the URLs of each remotes to the SSH version:
+
```sh
$ git remote set-url origin github:bmcandr/LISF
$ git remote set-url upstream github:NASA-LIS/LISF
```

. Verify that the URLs have been correctly updated:
+
```sh
$ git remote -v
> origin	github:bmcandr/LISF (fetch)
> origin	github:bmcandr/LISF (push)
> upstream	github:NASA-LIS/LISF (fetch)
> upstream	github:NASA-LIS/LISF (push)
```
